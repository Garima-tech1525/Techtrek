        <h2>Accessibility Statement</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to provide flexible and effective learning and skill development to empower organizations and individuals. We believe that high-quality educational content should be available to everyone, which is why accessibility is a key area of focus for us. 
        <hr>Our teams are constantly working to improve the accessibility of our services. Here are a few examples of how we are building a more accessible TechTrek platform:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accessibility guidelines.</strong></li>
            <p>We strive to follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 standard issued by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and use the Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) specification. We evaluate our website and mobile applications using the international version of the standard Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT).</p>

            <li><strong>Compatibility Testing.</strong></li>
            <p>We test our website and mobile applications for compatibility with multiple screen readers and accessibility tools, such as NonVisual Desktop Access (NVDA), Job Access with Speech (JAWSÂ®), Voiceover for the Macintosh Operating System (macOS) and iPhone Operating System (iOS), and Talkback for Android.</p>

            <li><strong>Design System.</strong></li>
            <p>Accessibility is a core principle of our internal design system. Our engineers and designers work with accessibility consultants on updates to our design system. </p>

            <li><strong>Instructor Recommendations.</strong></li>
            <p>We provide our instructors with recommendations on how to create accessible and inclusive courses.</p>

            <li><strong>Ongoing Research.</strong></li>
            <p>We work with accessibility consultants to audit and provide recommendations to improve the accessibility of our services.</p>
        </ul>
        <h2>Accessibility assistance</h2>
